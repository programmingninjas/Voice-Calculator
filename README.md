<h1 align="center"> Web based voice calculator to do mathematical operations. </h1>

* I used Web Speech API of javascript to record voice and then transferred input to *FLASK* with *AJAX*.
* I have used a library called numerizer to convert numerals into digits.

* #### You can perform the following mathematical operations:

  * Addition           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          SAY: "Add 1 + 2" or "1 plus 2"
  * Subtraction        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;         SAY: "Subtract 10-5" or "10 minus 5" 
  * Multiplication     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         SAY: "10 multiplied by 5" or "multiply 10 and 5"
  * Division           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;         SAY: "10 divided by 5" or "divide 10 by 5"
  * Logarithms         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;        SAY: "log 2" or "log 2 base 10"
  * Square Root        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;         SAY: "square root of 4"
  * Factorial          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;        SAY: "Factorial of 5"
  * Exponent           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;        SAY: "2 raised 10" or "2 power 10"

* #### Added new operations:
  
  * Find x for expressions (supported: linear,quadratic,cubic)   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;         SAY: "evaluate x square minus 4"
  * Integrate (supported: linear,quadratic,cubic)                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;         SAY: "integrate x square minus 4"
  * Differentiate (supported: linear,quadratic,cubic)            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;         SAY: "differentiate x square minus 4"
